## Hex fabric

So you heard I made a dress covered in R hex logos, and now you want to craft your own creation? You have a couple options!

- go to Spoonflower and purchase fabric from [my shop](https://www.spoonflower.com/en/fabric/8922748-r-hex-fabric-by-ameliamn). When I made my dress, I chose the Modern Jersey material, but there are many other options.

- download the Adobe Illustrator file or JPG file from here on GitHub, and upload your own image to Spoonflower or a different fabric design website. The thing to be aware of is how high-res that JPG file is. If you upload to Spoonflower as-is, you'll either get bigger hexes than I used for my dress (~6 inches wide) or you'll need to click the "smaller" button to get smaller hexes (~3 inches wide).
