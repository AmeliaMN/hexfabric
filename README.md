## Hex fabric

So you heard I made a dress covered in R hex logos, and now you want to craft your own creation? You have a couple options!

- go to Spoonflower and purchase fabric from [my shop](https://www.spoonflower.com/profiles/ameliamn). When I made my dress, I chose the Modern Jersey material, but there are many other fabric options. In addition to fabric, you can buy [wallpaper](https://www.spoonflower.com/wallpaper/8922748-r-hex-fabric-small-hexes-by-ameliamn) and [pre-made housewares](https://www.spoonflower.com/en/products/8922748) with this design. I'm working on getting a slightly larger version of the design approved because I think those bedspreads would look awesome with a bigger hex!

- download the Adobe Illustrator file or JPG file from here on GitHub, and upload your own image to Spoonflower or a different fabric design website. The thing to be aware of is how high-res that JPG file is. If you upload to Spoonflower as-is, you'll either get bigger hexes than I used for my dress (~7 inches wide) or you'll need to click the "smaller" button to get smaller hexes (~2 inches wide). 

All the files here are [CC0](LICENSE.md), meaning that you can use them for commercial purposes. This builds on the licenses of the existing stickers. If you want to modify the file and upload your own version to Spoonflower, that's fine!
